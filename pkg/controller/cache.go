// Without it, controller-runtime caches every object of every watched kind,
// cluster-wide and in full. This controller watches Nodes, Pods and
// PersistentVolumes, so on a large GPU cluster the default cache holds the
// entire Pod population of the cluster in the controller's heap — against a
// 1Gi limit. Two reductions are applied:
//
//   - Nodes are restricted to GPU nodes. Non-GPU nodes (control plane, CPU
//     workers, infra) are never targets, never run burn-in pods, and never need
//     health evaluation, so caching and watching them is pure overhead.
//
//   - managedFields is stripped from every cached object. It is metadata the
//     controllers never read and is frequently a large fraction of an object's
//     serialized size, particularly for Pods and CRs written by several
//     controllers.
//
// Pods are deliberately not label-scoped. The obvious selector,
// nvcre.nvidia.com/job, is injected only into the worker replicatedJob's pod
// template — MPI launcher pods do not carry it (see workerTargetJob in
// pkg/workload), and the launcher is exactly the pod that NCCL bandwidth
// measurement and timeout log capture read from. Scoping on that label would
// make launchers invisible to the cache. Pod reads are instead kept cheap via
// field indexes; see indexes.go.
